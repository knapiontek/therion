Dear Sir or Madam,

\parindent 0.4in

I am writing to you in regards to your \textit{Pre-advise note} I have received recently.

The content of this note shows that I still have an open account in your bank (98-60-60 01531091). This information is very surprising for me as I made a number of phone calls, emails and personal visit to Ulster Bank branch trying to finalize my bank account closure.

I obtained the prove that my bank account had been closed on 2 August 2013. I wasn't aware about the situation until yesterday when I received some information about charges on my none existing account.

I am attaching a photocopy of my \textit{Request to Close}. Please clarify this situation and inform me about your decision so I could take appropriate legal steps.
