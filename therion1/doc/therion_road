In order to compile therion from the scratch:

1.	Download source code for therionc++.
	This project contains the code of generated C++ for:
	* build - make-like tool oriented on therion
    * langen - compiler compiler, used also for generating therion code
    * therion - generator, uses "build" and "langen" to build therion executable

2.	Download source code for proper therion.
	Tools build, langen, therion are rebuild from the therion lang source.
	Other tools are generated afterwards using therion lang based tools.

3.	Therion has backends for C++ and mono.CIL.
	All therion code can be converted to pure C++ code at any time to support
	users who dont want to stick with therion as a devel tool.
