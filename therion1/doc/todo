* now

change plus -> star in .pro[n] files where nessessary
Field+ -> Field* does not work
Erase-iterator in all collections
unique fields in clazz (tho)
@ worker_seq[address.no][address.street.name] address offset calculated 2x
obgen::cast(square) forgets dots address.no -> addressno
Model::list user defined has to have guards in prototype.hpp
.pro aliases cause state machine to grow
no throw/no action in ctor (obgen ClazzIterator, Runtime::Iterator)
change recursion into iteration in langen
minimize Machine::Node by replacing map/set with seq/sort
item->unique is never true 1-used + 1-defined = 2
obgen.cpp does not check all ptrs for null

* known bugs

* make
check if #include is nessesary

* langen

prototype: byte can borrow input_id from parent, ensure that order of borrowing is correct
metatargets $W $w $.
copy instead of copy ctor for collections
add Pair to collections with key() value() found()
'00 will not have special treatment, overload reduction needed
check if translation is available in pl (env specially)
the_average_line_size - change name/refactoring of all occures
::isalphanum() will be covered in charset namespace i.e. charset::isalphanum()
remove hardcoded dependency on output/pager (it's messy, partly hardcoded, partly read from #include's)

* long term tasks

source dependencies tool, check for unwanted #include<>
queue based on atomic operations, atomicqueue.h
Log is very poor - prints only to stdout
test if a single file can be compiled alone (includes all nessesary headers)
check returned pointer in all allocating functions
check if assert used properly/undef assert will remove only not wanted code
cairo diagrams/grid monitoring tool
openssl
