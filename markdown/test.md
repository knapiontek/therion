## Employment Experience

[>|<]
[ 07/2015 - present | *NuoDB* ]

[ 11/2007 - 06/2015 | *Micro Focus (formerly IONA Technologies, Dublin)* ]
[ | Micro Focus delivers middleware solutions. Main products are Orbix and Artix. Orbix is the leading implementation of CORBA. Artix is successor of Orbix and is based on Web Services and implements ESB. ]
[ | Main responsibilities: ]
  - Last year development task was delivery of full integration of Orbix C++ with Actional. Actional is monitoring tool. It gives users of Orbix full ability to snoop CORBA invocations and track errors.
  - Mantainace of existing code. Bugfixes and debugging.
[ | Platforms: SunOS, Linux, Windows, HP-UX, AIX ]

[ 08/2004 - 10/2007 | *Aircraft Management Technologies (Malahide, Ireland)* ]
[ | AMT delivers specific aircraft software solutions for airlines. The main focus of the system is management and replication of distributed databases where connections between airborne planes and the airport server is not always guaranteed. The system optimizes a connection price (SAT, GPRS, GSM, Wireless) and an amount of data to achieve minimum costs and maximum usability. ]
[ | Involved in:
  - Design and implementation of a subscription and publishing data system (XPath filters define data flow between aircrafts and ground server)
  - Design and implementation of a large content management system (transport of files by means of available media and protocols)
  - Significant improvement of speed of the system core (migration from JDBC-based client to PL/SQL procedures - avoiding unnecessary network traffic, further optimisation)
  - Adaptation of the company software to the Boeing hardware (JNI)
  - Embedding Java applications in an OS environment (Windows and Linux API) ]

[ 09/2001 - 06/2004 | *Systherm-Info (Poznan, Poland)* ]
[ | Main revenue stream - distributed spatial data systems for government departments (numeric maps, GIS and database applications).
The primary project was a spatial data manager. The system created a graphics view of remote databases. User was obtaining current or past state of the reality. The system had ability of simultaneous work with a few databases (SQL Server, Oracle and Pervasive) all at once. The system had a general mechanism to extend the interface for a new kind of a database. ]
[ | Involved in:
  - Design and implementation of multidimensional index for specific applications (*indexing vector objects* in a storage)
  - Design and implementation of a drawing system (*fast geometric algorithms*)
  - Design and implementation of transport layer
  - Replication and data merging system (i.e. merging two map snapshots of different time-stamp)
  - High level functions for users of the system engaged in entering data ]

[ 06/1999 - 09/2001 | *Xnet Communications (Poland, German subsidiary)* ]
[ | The company specialized in network communication. Tasks related to implementation of systems controlling data flow in the network (e.g. acquisition of data from distributed cash-registers). The central unit of the system was an FTP server and a scheduler. The engine was configured with Lua scripts (see lua.org). ]
[ | Involved in:
  - Implementation of distributed file management system (core and GUI)
  - Implementation of transport layer based on modems
  - Implementation of the FTP client and extensions of FTP server
  - SMTP implementation ]
